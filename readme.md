Answering on your questions and requests:

1. I managed somehow set up Maven project, but as I am not familiar with that technology only you can say if it was made right. 
2. I've deleted the compiled parts of project.
3. I've created the class for cashBoxes, but I cannot understand your example with intensities of people. 
4. I've added two junit tests for an example input and for mine. 
5. I probably found and fixed the problem, that was related to the space after input line.
